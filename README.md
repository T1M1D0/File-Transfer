# File-Transfer
This project is being made so i can continue to learn python and specifically the socket library in python. 
I know this is very simple and i know apps already exist but i just want to make it on my own for whenever i want to transfer files from computer to computer. 
I encourage whoever sees this program to make it their own! 
I hope you guys have a great day!
